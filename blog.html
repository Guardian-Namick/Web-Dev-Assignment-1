</h3>

		<li>
So far the challenges I've had with this has been keeping my computer working, as well as doing images and hyperlinks. I have worked through with a little bit of help from my roommate
		</li>
		<li>
I learned a lot, namely, paragraphs, lists, headers, links, images and hosting it on git pages.
		</li>
		<li>
I used the class notes mostly and some help from roommate with the image and hyperlinks
		</li>

			The biggest problems I had were changing the images, as in like getting them to fit inline, or become a circle and to the right side. As well as Getting the Twits to be in a grid, finnaly accomplished it though. Filling in the color of the header completely so it doesnt have a boarder of grey. And last but not least getting the search bar to the right side. 
		</li>
		<li>
			I learned a lot, since all of this is new to me, and I did have a "ooh this works" moment	
		</li>
		<li>
			I ended up using a lot for this assignment. So far I've gotten help from a websites on css styleing, though most of it I've been able to do because of the notes for the class. I mostly used these resources to help with a problem that I couldn't solve with what I had. 
		</li>
		<li>
			I know I had to google how to make it so links dont show blue, but instead are whatever color I want. as well as how to get rid of hte underline below it.
		</li>

			Blog post number 3!
		</h3>
		
		<li>
			I think the biggest thing i had trouble with was the search bar, mainly because i wasnt accessing the text as i thought i was and it took me a while to figure out how to access the text, and once i got that working it was pretty much done!
		</li>
		<li>
			I learned a ton because this was the first time i had used JavaScript, but i had some fun AHAH! moments, like realizing how i could use the "Hidden" tag to show or hide twits for the search.
		</li>
		<li>
			I extensivlely used google for tons of help figuring out different preset functions worked, such as "appendChild" and i used the notes some, but they confused me somewhat. Though i also made a lot of progress during the last class before this was due.
		</li>
		<li>
			As said above, i googled how to attach things, and found appendChild. I also looked up most of the "find"something commands.
		</li>

		<h3>
			Blog post number 4!
		</h3>
		
		<li>
			The biggest issue i had was trying to figure out how to get anything started, because there was nearly nothing i could find about the server code and i couldnt figure out how to load stuff and do something with it until my roommate helped out.
		</li>
		<li>
			I have learned that 1 there is almost no information about node js commands/functions and that readfile and readfilesync do different things which you wouldnt know based on the very limited information about them.
		</li>
		<li>
			My roommates helped explain how to load the files
		</li>
		<li>
			Basically i tried googling everything, but nothing was useful besides repeating the same code everywhere.
		</li>
