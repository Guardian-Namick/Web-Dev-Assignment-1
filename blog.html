So far the challenges I've had with this has been keeping my computer working, as well as doing images and hyperlinks. I have worked through with a little bit of help from my roommate
		</li>
		<li>
I learned a lot, namely, paragraphs, lists, headers, links, images and hosting it on git pages.
		</li>
		<li>
I used the class notes mostly and some help from roommate with the image and hyperlinks

			The biggest problems I had were changing the images, as in like getting them to fit inline, or become a circle and to the right side. As well as Getting the Twits to be in a grid, finnaly accomplished it though. Filling in the color of the header completely so it doesnt have a boarder of grey. And last but not least getting the search bar to the right side.

			I learned a lot, since all of this is new to me, and I did have a "ooh this works" moment	
		</li>
		<li>
			I ended up using a lot for this assignment. So far I've gotten help from a websites on css styleing, though most of it I've been able to do because of the notes for the class. I mostly used these resources to help with a problem that I couldn't solve with what I had.

			I know I had to google how to make it so links dont show blue, but instead are whatever color I want. as well as how to get rid of hte underline below it.
